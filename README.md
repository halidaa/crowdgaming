# Crowd Gaming
This game is my submission for Crowd Programming class. In this game, every player is playing the same game, trying to move their pawn right or left. Moves are decided from the average of everyone's decision.

## Game Modes
There are two modes in this game, one is  Avoid the Monsters and the other is Catch the Children. In Avoid the Monsters, players move right and left to avoid being caught by a monster. The game ends the moment your pawn is caught. In Catch the Children, players move right and left to catch as many children as possible. The game ends when you reach a certain amount of point.

## How It Works
The game collects everyones' input (right, left, or stay) and decides on a move that is favored by majority of the crowd. In a smarter mode, the game also considers each player's success history as a weight to their decision.
